# ARM-Assembler-Compiler
A quick and easy shell compiler script that prompts the user for the 
name of the .s file before compiling it into a .o file

Simply run the .sh file from your Terminal/Console by typing:
# sh compiler.sh
or in the case of permission issues:
# sudo sh compiler.sh

The script will ask you for the name of your Assembler .s file. Please
be sure to NOT include the file extension. For example, if we had a .s
file called "test.s", we would input "test" (removing the '.s' from
the input)
